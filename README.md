## Overall Project Code Structure

So far, the project consists of three parts:

### General Start Guide

1. [Download the Google App Engine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) for Python development.
2. Set up/locally run a new application/project for each application (the root folders of which can be individually identified by the existence of app.yaml file).
3. Develop/debug on a branch.
4. Create pull request and merge (if authorised).
5. Deploy to live site (if authorised).
