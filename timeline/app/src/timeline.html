                                <p class="grid-1-3">During WWII, human computers, mostly women, performed highly complex mathematical calculations, including formulas related to nuclear fission. The computers normally earned about half of what their male counterparts earned.</p>
                                <p class="grid-1-3">Many of the very first computer programmers were women who had been some of the best of the human computers. In fact, programming began as a female pioneering profession and remained so until its intellectual prestige prompted our patriarchal system to <a href="http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">rebrand it as a male profession.</a></p>

                <h2>An Intersectional Perspective</h2>

                <p>Although every person featured in the timeline is an underdog, not every one of them is an intersectional feminist. But it's important and empowering for us, the angsty feminists in tech, and you, the readers, to be critically aware and to become conscious of intersectionality.</p>

                <img class="right" src="img/watering-the-brain.png" alt="Drawing of a brain being watered">
                <p>One of the featured persons in the timeline, Katherine Johnson, was regarded a child mathematics prodigy with a thirst for learning. But her story wouldn’t be complete without the critical roles of her supportive family and the great teachers that nurtured her genius along the way. As a black woman, likely also significant in her journey to her achievements is her experience of growing up in West Virginia, which she described as being less blatantly racist than Virginia, where she would go on to work.</p>

                <p>We recognise that often accomplishments by oppressed persons are possible not only because of their individual brilliance and perseverance but because of their other privileges*&mdash;opportunities for education, physical and psychological safety, support of their families and communities, food in their stomachs and roof over their heads, financial security and time. Intelligence, something that many of us find easy to dismiss as innate and hereditary, also does not exist in a vacuum, with studies showing the adverse effects of poverty on academic performance. Opportunity is not based on luck but is a product of our privileges: hence our oppressed identities cannot be divorced from our finding or grasping of an opportunity.</p>

                <img class="left" src="img/opportunity-and-equity.png" alt="One person successfully climbing to a door while the other cannot reach it">
                <p>Celebrating the successes of these underdogs in tech despite their disadvantages shouldn’t shame those in our communities who have found this environment too toxic, who have been pushed away from this field before they could thrive, who have been worn out by our culture and biases. Instead, this celebration is a callout for the need for equity and opportunities so that we—the underdogs—can all succeed. This timeline, and our lived experiences, show that our participation blows away any grounds for bias and discriminatory essentialism. And frankly, just listen to our voices! Sometimes, we just need to see the people that look like us thrive, feel a sense of pride in our community, and hope to shake away some of our loneliness.</p>

                <p class="footnote"><span class="asterisk">*</span>"Privilege" is arguably a bit of a misnomer as we don't fight to take away privileges—we work to lift up those who do not have them. It's more appropriate to interpret them as our basic rights and dignity.</p>
