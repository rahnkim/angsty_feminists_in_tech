                <h2>A Letter From the Angsties</h2>

                <p>Although every person featured in the timeline is an underdog, not every one of them is an intersectional feminist. But it's important for our growth and empowerment to become more critically aware.</p>

                <img class="right" src="img/watering-the-brain.png" alt="Drawing of a brain being watered">
                <p>One of the featured persons in the timeline, Katherine Johnson, was regarded a child mathematics prodigy with a thirst for learning. However, Katherine’s story is bigger than her—her story wouldn’t be complete without the significant roles of her supportive family and the great teachers that nurtured her genius along the way. Growing up a black woman in an area that <a href="http://www.visionaryproject.org/johnsonkatherine/" target="_blank">she described as less blatantly racist</a> was likely also significant in her journey.</p>

                <p>We recognise that accomplishments are possible not only because of someone’s individual brilliance and perseverance but also because of their privileges&mdash;opportunities for education, physical and psychological safety, support of their families and communities, food in their stomachs and roof over their heads, geographical locations, financial security, and time. Intelligence, something that many of us find easy to dismiss as innate and hereditary, also does not exist in a vacuum, with studies showing the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/poverty-disturbs-children-s-brain-development-and-academic-performance/" target ="_blank">adverse effects of poverty on academic performance</a>. Opportunity is not based on luck but is a product of our privileges: hence our oppressed identities cannot be divorced from our access to opportunities.</p>

                <img class="left" src="img/opportunity-and-equity.png" alt="One person successfully climbing to a door while the other cannot reach it">
                <p>So let’s talk about colour, let’s talk about gender, and let’s talk about privilege. Let’s talk about why so many women feel the need to become “one of the guys” in order to survive in tech.</p>

                <p>Celebrating the successes of these underdogs in tech shouldn’t shame those in our communities who have found this environment too toxic, who have been pushed away from this field before they could thrive, who have been worn out by our culture and biases. Instead, this celebration is a callout for the need for equity and opportunities so that we—the underdogs—can all succeed and be our whole selves. This timeline and our lived experiences show that our participation blows away any grounds for bias and discriminatory essentialism. And to be honest, we sometimes just need to see the people that look like us thrive, feel a sense of pride in our community, and hope to shake away some of our loneliness.</p>
